            <p>Food courts consist of a number of vendors at food stalls or service counters.
                 Meals are ordered at one of the vendors and then carried to a common dining area,
                 often using a common food tray standardized across all the court's vendors. 
                 The food may also be ordered as takeout for consumption at another location, 
                 such as a home or workplace. In this case, it may be packaged in plastic or foam food containers on location.
                 Vendors at food courts may also sell pre-packaged meals for consumers to take home.
                 Food is usually eaten with plastic cutlery, and sporks are sometimes used to avoid the necessity of providing both forks and spoons.
                 There are exceptions: Carrefour Laval requires its food court tenants to use solid dinnerware and cutlery which it provides.
                 Typical North American and European food courts have mostly fast-food chains (such as McDonald's, Sbarro, and Panda Express) in combination with other independent vendors.</p>
